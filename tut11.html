    The Problem we are dealing with is, how to insert extra space in html, as it only inserts one space 
    between 2 different charactrs, no metter how much spaces we do insert in the code between them.

    <br>
    <b>Solution is "&nbsp;" <b>&nbsp;</b>, writing &lt;nbsp&gt; </b>.
    nbsp is non breaking space.
    <br>
    our next problem is how to write <p>The paragraph tag</p>
    That can be written using <b>& lt; < p > & gt; </b> without the spaces in between.
    <br>
    Above shown are the two uses of HTML entities. 
    We can use entities to use reserved letters and the ones which are not in our keyboard. 
    Some more examples are shown below.<br>
    <p>Copyright is written like &copy;</p>
    <p>pound is written like &pound;</p>
    <p>Dollar is written like &dollar;</p>
    <p>Empty Character is written like this, which you can copy also. &#8203;</p>
    <br>
