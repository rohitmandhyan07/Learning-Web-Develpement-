    <h2>Sementic Elements</h2>
    
    This is the image given here
in which the header is at the top
this is nav,
this is section, article, aside or footer, ok
So, all these are the semantic elements
So, you can use the header tag
to indicate that this tag is your header.
That is, at the top of the website
You can use the nav
to show that this is your website
this is the navigation bar of your website.
There's no content inside it
there's a navigation bar inside
So whatever search engines, scrollers
or whatever else shows your preview of the website
Like you share the link on Facebook
then the preview is shown
then all those people who are there
will be able to know this thing very comfortably
that which is the navigation bar, which is the actual section,
which is the actual article, which is the footer,
what is the thing lying in the aside
All these things will be randomly indicated in your website
Now the question arises whether it is necessary to use it
Look it is not important
if you use it
then the probability of increasing the rank
of your website increases.<br>

Speaker 1: This audio used for the Transcriber test at Go Transcript.


Speaker 2: Umm, Okay,. Well Steve, I'd like to ask you how you day was. I understand you had some problems with a machine. Can you tell me about this while I do the dishes or start talking


Speaker 1:  Held between the balancing machine, we found out that the low sensors on the left side and the right side of both work by swapping the tables.

But the Indication on the screen, still shows no load values and grams on the left side. 

I expected the circuit board, see if we have any loose connection wire. 

[inaudible 00:00:54] [inaudible 00:01:00] showing error. Signal won't actually show you anything. This is trying to show the circuit, but it not, the correct value. And, Coupled with that the timing on the weight and balance account control about 90 degrees, [unintelligible 00:01:15] , off-axis. It should be 0 degrees.

   

                
Speaker 1:  [Sound] [unintelligible 00:01:20]-[unintelligible 00:01:31] 


Speaker 1: , and It shows it at 90 degrees[unintelligible 00:01:33] -[unintelligible 00:01:38] , instead of a 180 degrees.

[unintelligible 00:01:40] - [unintelligible 00:01:49] 

So we need to get often a miracle out there to calibration of the units.  

                  
Speaker 2: Start talking!


Speaker 1: So, held between the balancing machine [unintelligible 00:00:23] .


Speaker 1:  [Sound]
